AIM:
To implement and demonstrate the concept of interrupt handling in C++ using signal handling.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Include the header file <csignal> for signal handling.
Define a user-defined class (for example, InterruptHandler).
Inside the class, define a static function to handle interrupts.
Use the signal() function to register the interrupt handler (for SIGINT).
Run an infinite loop to simulate continuous execution.
When the user presses Ctrl + C, the interrupt handler function gets executed.
Display a message indicating the interrupt has been caught.
End the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
#include <csignal>
#include <unistd.h>   // For sleep()
using namespace std;

class InterruptHandler {
public:
    static void handleInterrupt(int signalNum) {
        cout << "\nInterrupt signal (" << signalNum << ") received!" << endl;
        cout << "Gracefully shutting down program..." << endl;
        exit(signalNum);
    }
};

int main() {
    // Register signal handler for Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
    signal(SIGINT, InterruptHandler::handleInterrupt);

    cout << "Program running. Press Ctrl + C to trigger interrupt..." << endl;

    while (true) {
        cout << "Working..." << endl;
        sleep(2);  // Pause for 2 seconds
    }

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT :
Program running. Press Ctrl + C to trigger interrupt...
Working...
Working...

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates interrupt handling in C++ by catching the SIGINT signal (Ctrl + C) using a user-defined class and static function, showcasing the concept of graceful program termination using OOP principles.
