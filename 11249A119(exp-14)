AIM:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate the concept of static data members and static member functions, which are shared by all objects of a class.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Define a class (e.g., Student) with:
A static data member count
A static member function showCount()
Increment the static member in the constructor whenever a new object is created.
Call the static member function to display the count of objects.
Observe that all objects share the same static data member.
Stop the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int roll;
    string name;

public:
    static int count; // static data member

    // Constructor
    Student(int r, string n) {
        roll = r;
        name = n;
        count++; // increment count whenever object is created
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Roll: " << roll << ", Name: " << name << endl;
    }

    // Static member function
    static void showCount() {
        cout << "Total Students: " << count << endl;
    }
};

// Initialize static data member outside the class
int Student::count = 0;

int main() {
    Student s1(1, "Alice");
    Student s2(2, "Bob");

    s1.display();
    s2.display();

    // Call static function using class name
    Student::showCount();

    return 0;
}

 OUTPUT:
Roll: 1, Name: Alice
Roll: 2, Name: Bob
Total Students: 2

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates:Static data member count shared by all objects.Static member function showCount() can be called without any object and accesses the static data member.
