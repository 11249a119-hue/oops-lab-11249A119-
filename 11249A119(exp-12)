AIM:
To write a program in C++ to demonstrate:Passing objects as arguments to a member function.Returning an object from a member function.

ALGORITHM:
For Passing Object as Argument:
Start the program.
Define a class (e.g., Number) with a data member.
Create a member function that accepts an object of the same class as a parameter.
Perform operations using the passed object.
For Returning Object:
Define a member function that performs some operation and returns an object of the same class.
Call the function from main() and store the returned object.
Display the results.
Stop the program.

PROGRAM :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Number {
    int num;

public:
    // Constructor
    Number(int n = 0) {
        num = n;
    }

    // Function to add two Number objects (passing object as argument)
    Number add(Number n) {
        Number temp;
        temp.num = num + n.num;
        return temp; // returning object
    }

    // Function to display value
    void display() {
        cout << "Value: " << num << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Number n1(10), n2(20), n3;

    // Passing object as argument and returning object
    n3 = n1.add(n2);

    cout << "First Number: "; n1.display();
    cout << "Second Number: "; n2.display();
    cout << "Sum: "; n3.display();

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT :
First Number: Value: 10
Second Number: Value: 20
Sum: Value: 30

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates:Passing objects as arguments to member functions.Returning objects from member functions in C++.
