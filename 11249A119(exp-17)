AIM:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate the concept of friend function, which can access private and protected members of a class without being a member of the class.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Define a class (e.g., Rectangle) with private data members like length and width.
Declare a friend function inside the class.
Define the friend function outside the class.
Call the friend function in main() by passing the object(s) of the class.
The friend function can access private members of the class.
Stop the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
    int length, width;

public:
    // Constructor
    Rectangle(int l, int w) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }

    // Friend function declaration
    friend int area(Rectangle r);
};

// Friend function definition
int area(Rectangle r) {
    return r.length * r.width; // Accessing private members
}

int main() {
    Rectangle rect(10, 5);

    cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << area(rect) << endl;

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Area of Rectangle: 50

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates friend function, which can access the private members of a class without being a member of the class.
