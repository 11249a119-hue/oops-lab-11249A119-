EXP NO :24

Aim :
To implement multilevel inheritance in C++ where a class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.

Algorithm :
Start the program.
Create a base class Base with data members and member functions.
Create a derived class Derived1 that inherits from Base.
Create another derived class Derived2 that inherits from Derived1.
Access data members and member functions of the base class using the object of Derived2.
Display the results.
Stop the program.

Program :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Base {
protected:
    int a;
public:
    void setA(int x) {
        a = x;
    }
    void showA() {
        cout << "Value of a = " << a << endl;
    }
};

// First derived class
class Derived1 : public Base {
protected:
    int b;
public:
    void setB(int y) {
        b = y;
    }
    void showB() {
        cout << "Value of b = " << b << endl;
    }
};

// Second derived class (multilevel)
class Derived2 : public Derived1 {
private:
    int c;
public:
    void setC(int z) {
        c = z;
    }
    void showC() {
        cout << "Value of c = " << c << endl;
    }
    void showSum() {
        cout << "Sum of a, b, c = " << a + b + c << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived2 obj;

    obj.setA(10);  // Base class member
    obj.setB(20);  // Derived1 class member
    obj.setC(30);  // Derived2 class member

    cout << "Using Multilevel Inheritance:" << endl;
    obj.showA();
    obj.showB();
    obj.showC();
    obj.showSum();

    return 0;
}

Output :
Using Multilevel Inheritance:
Value of a = 10
Value of b = 20
Value of c = 30
Sum of a, b, c = 60

Result :
The program demonstrates multilevel inheritance, where Derived2 inherits from Derived1, which in turn inherits from Base, allowing access to all members in the hierarchy.
