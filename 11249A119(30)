AIM:
To implement and demonstrate the concept of file handling (reading from and writing to a file) in C++.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Include the header file <fstream> for file operations.
Create an ofstream object to write data into a file.
Open the file using the open() function or constructor.
Write data to the file using the insertion operator (<<).
Close the file using the close() function.
Create an ifstream object to read data from the file.
Open the file again for reading.
Read and display the contents using the extraction operator (>>) or getline().
Close the file and end the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int age;

    // Writing to a file
    ofstream outFile("student.txt"); // Create and open file for writing
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    getline(cin, name);
    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;

    outFile << "Name: " << name << endl;
    outFile << "Age: " << age << endl;
    outFile.close();
    cout << "\nData written to file successfully.\n";

    // Reading from the file
    ifstream inFile("student.txt"); // Open file for reading
    string line;

    cout << "\nReading data from file:\n";
    while (getline(inFile, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }
    inFile.close();

    return 0;
    }
    
    
OUTPUT:
Enter your name: John Doe
Enter your age: 20

Data written to file successfully.

Reading data from file:
Name: John Doe
Age: 20

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates file handling in C++ by writing data to a file and then reading it back.
