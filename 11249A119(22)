Aim
To implement single inheritance using public and private inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++.

Algorithm :
Start the program.
Create a base class named Base with data members and member functions.
Derive another class named DerivedPublic from Base using public inheritance.
Derive another class named DerivedPrivate from Base using private inheritance.
Show that in public inheritance, public members of the base class remain public in the derived class.
Show that in private inheritance, public members of the base class become private in the derived class.
Create objects of derived classes and access base class members as allowed by inheritance type.
Display the output.
Stop the program.

Program :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Base {
protected:
    int a;
public:
    void setData(int x) {
        a = x;
    }
    void showData() {
        cout << "Value of a = " << a << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class using public inheritance
class DerivedPublic : public Base {
public:
    void display() {
        cout << "Publicly Inherited Class: ";
        showData();
    }
};

// Derived class using private inheritance
class DerivedPrivate : private Base {
public:
    void setAndShow(int y) {
        setData(y);
        cout << "Privately Inherited Class: ";
        showData();
    }
};

int main() {
    DerivedPublic obj1;
    DerivedPrivate obj2;

    cout << "Using Public Inheritance:" << endl;
    obj1.setData(10);    // allowed (public remains public)
    obj1.display();

    cout << "\nUsing Private Inheritance:" << endl;
    // obj2.setData(20); // not allowed — setData() becomes private in DerivedPrivate
    obj2.setAndShow(20);

    return 0;
}

Output :
Using Public Inheritance:
Publicly Inherited Class: Value of a = 10

Using Private Inheritance:
Privately Inherited Class: Value of a = 20


Result :
Thus, a C++ program demonstrating single inheritance using both public and private modes of inheritance was successfully implemented and verified
