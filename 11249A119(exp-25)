EXP NO:25

AIM:
To implement and demonstrate the use of the this pointer and inline function using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Create a class named Student.
Define data members such as name and marks.
Define a member function setData() that uses the this pointer to assign values to data members.
Define an inline function display() to print the student details.
In the main() function, create an object of the class.
Call the member functions using the object.
Display the results.
End the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    string name;
    int marks;

public:
    // Using 'this' pointer
    void setData(string name, int marks) {
        this->name = name;      // 'this' pointer differentiates between data member and parameter
        this->marks = marks;
    }

    // InliStudent Name: John
Marks: 85ne function to display data
    inline void display() {
        cout << "Student Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Marks: " << marks << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;

    s1.setData("John", 85);
    s1.display();

    return 0;
}


OUTPUT :
Student Name: John
Marks: 85

RESULT :
The program successfully demonstrates the use of the this pointer to access class data members and the use of an inline function in C++.

OUTPUT :
