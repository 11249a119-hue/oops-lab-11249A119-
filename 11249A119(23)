Aim :
To implement the concept of multiple inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++.

Algorithm :
Start the program.
Create two base classes, Base1 and Base2, each with data members and member functions.
Create a derived class, Derived, that inherits from both Base1 and Base2.
Access and display the members of both base classes through the derived class object.
Stop the program.

Program :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// First Base class
class Base1 {
protected:
    int x;
public:
    void setX(int a) {
        x = a;
    }
    void showX() {
        cout << "Value of x = " << x << endl;
    }
};

// Second Base class
class Base2 {
protected:
    int y;
public:
    void setY(int b) {
        y = b;
    }
    void showY() {
        cout << "Value of y = " << y << endl;
    }
};

// Derived class inheriting from Base1 and Base2
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    void displaySum() {
        cout << "Sum of x and y = " << x + y << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived obj;

    obj.setX(10);   // from Base1
    obj.setY(20);   // from Base2

    cout << "Using Multiple Inheritance:" << endl;
    obj.showX();    // from Base1
    obj.showY();    // from Base2
    obj.displaySum(); // from Derived

    return 0;
}

Output :
Using Multiple Inheritance:
Value of x = 10
Value of y = 20
Sum of x and y = 30

Result :
The C++ program successfully demonstrates multiple inheritance, where the Derived class inherits properties and functions from two base classes and uses them together
