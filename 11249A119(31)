EXP NO : 31

AIM:
To implement and demonstrate the use of exception handling using try, throw, and catch blocks in C++.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Declare variables for input (for example, numerator and denominator).
Use a try block to execute code that might cause an exception.
Inside the try block, check if the denominator is zero before performing division.
If the denominator is zero, throw an exception using the throw keyword.
Catch the exception in a catch block and display an appropriate message.
If no exception occurs, display the result of the division.
End the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int numerator, denominator, result;

    cout << "Enter numerator: ";
    cin >> numerator;
    cout << "Enter denominator: ";
    cin >> denominator;

    try {
        if (denominator == 0)
            throw "Division by zero error!";
        
        result = numerator / denominator;
        cout << "Result = " << result << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Exception caught: " << msg << endl;
    }

    cout << "Program continues after exception handling..." << endl;
    return 0;
}


 OUTPUT:

Case 1: Valid input

Enter numerator: 10
Enter denominator: 2
Result = 5
Program continues after exception handling...


Case 2: Division by zero

Enter numerator: 8
Enter denominator: 0
Exception caught: Division by zero error!
Program continues after exception handling...

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates the concept of exception handling using try, throw, and catch blocks in C++.
