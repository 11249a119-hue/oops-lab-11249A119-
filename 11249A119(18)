EXP NO: 17

AIM:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate the concept of friend class, where all members of one class can access the private and protected members of another class.

ALGORITHM:
Start the program.
Define a class (e.g., ClassA) with private data members.
Declare another class (e.g., ClassB) as a friend class of ClassA.
In ClassB, define a member function to access private members of ClassA.
Create objects of both classes in main().
Call the function of ClassB to access ClassA’s private members.
Stop the program.

PROGRAM:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class ClassB; // Forward declaration

class ClassA {
private:
    int num;

public:
    ClassA(int n) { num = n; }

    // Declare ClassB as a friend
    friend class ClassB;
};

class ClassB {
public:
    void show(ClassA a) {
        // Accessing private member of ClassA
        cout << "Value of num in ClassA: " << a.num << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    ClassA a1(42);
    ClassB b1;

    b1.show(a1); // Access private member via friend class

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Value of num in ClassA: 42

RESULT:
The program successfully demonstrates friend class, where all member functions of ClassB can access the private members of ClassA.
