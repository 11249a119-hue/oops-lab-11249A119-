EXP NO:7

AIM:
To write a C++ program to demonstrate member functions defined inside and outside the class.

ALGORITHM :
Start the program
Define a class named Library.
Inside the class:
Declare data members like bookName, author, and price.
Define one member function inside the class (e.g., getDetails() to take input).
Declare another member function (e.g., displayDetails()), but only declare it here — define it outside the class using the scope resolution operator ::.
In the main() function:
Create an object of the class.
Call both member functions.
End the program

PROGRAM :
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Library {
private:
    string bookName;
    string author;
    float price;

public:
    // Member function defined INSIDE the class
    void getDetails() {
        cout << "Enter Book Name: ";
        getline(cin, bookName);
        cout << "Enter Author Name: ";
        getline(cin, author);
        cout << "Enter Price: ";
        cin >> price;
    }

    // Declaration of member function (to be defined OUTSIDE)
    void displayDetails();
};

// Member function defined OUTSIDE the class
void Library::displayDetails() {
    cout << "\n--- Book Details ---" << endl;
    cout << "Book Name : " << bookName << endl;
    cout << "Author    : " << author << endl;
    cout << "Price     : $" << price << endl;
}

int main() {
    Library book;

    cout << "=== Library Management System ===" << endl;

    // Clear input buffer (important when using getline after cin)
    cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');

    book.getDetails();
    book.displayDetails();

    return 0;
}

OUTPUT:
Enter Book Name: The C++ Programming Language
Enter Author Name: Bjarne Stroustrup
Enter Price: 59.99

Book Details
Book Name : The C++ Programming Language
Author    : Bjarne Stroustrup
Price     : 59.99

RESULT :
     The program was executed successfully
